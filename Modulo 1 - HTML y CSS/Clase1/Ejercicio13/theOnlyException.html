    <p>
        When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
        And curse at the wind
        He broke his own heart and I watched
        As he tried to reassemble it
        And my momma swore
        That she would never let herself forget
        And that was the day that I promised
        I'd never sing of love if it does not exist
        But darling, you are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
        That love never lasts
        And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
        Or keep a straight face
        And I've always lived like this
        Keeping a comfortable distance
        And up until now I had sworn to myself
        That I'm content with loneliness
        Because none of it was ever worth the risk
        But you are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        I've got a tight grip on reality
        But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
        I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
        Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        You are the only exception
        And I'm on my way to believing
        Oh, and I'm on my way to believing
    </p>
